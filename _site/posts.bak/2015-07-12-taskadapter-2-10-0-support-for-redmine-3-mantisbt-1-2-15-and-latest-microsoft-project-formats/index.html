    <p>Good news, everyone! Big changes in TaskAdapter 2.10.0:</p>

<h3 id="support-for-redmine-30">Support for Redmine 3.0.</h3>

<p>Redmine 3.0 introduced new dates format that previous TaskAdapter versions could not parse.
This required us releasing a new version of Redmine Java API libarary and integrating it into TaskAdapter.
Enjoy Redmine 3.0.x integration!</p>

<h3 id="support-for-mantisbt-1215">Support for MantisBT 1.2.15.</h3>

<p>TaskAdapter was already tested to work with MantisBT previously, and now it is using the latest MantisBT
native integration library, which should bring more stability.</p>

<p>Also, a bug was fixed where tasks created in MantisBT could not be updated by TaskAdapter later.</p>

<h3 id="better-support-for-latest-microsoft-project-formats">Better support for latest Microsoft Project formats.</h3>

<p>Microsoft Project 2010, Microsoft Project 2013 and Microsoft Project 2016.
This version will include multiple bugfixes and improvements to make reading and writing these files more reliable.</p>

<h3 id="some-gui-bugfixes">Some GUI bugfixes.</h3>

<p>A newer version of the UI library is used, which resolves some minor UI bugs.</p>

<h3 id="better-logging">Better logging.</h3>

<p>When something goes wrong, TaskAdapter will now provide more user-friendly messages in the output (both UI and console log)</p>
