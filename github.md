					<p>Github is a popular web-site for hosting&nbsp;Git repositories. It &nbsp;also offers Issues management, similar to bug trackers like MantisBT and Jira. Although Githubâ€™s issues management is quite simple (it lacks time estimates and many other features), it is actually very convenient, fast, and user friendly.<br>
Sometimes you need to export your tasks from Microsoft Project, Atlassian Jira or other systems to Github. This is when&nbsp;Task Adapter comes in handy. It saves the time you would spend manually coping/pasting tasks from the other systems.</p>
